I wanted to follow up on our conversation today regarding your aux mode utilization and guideline adherence.

We discussed the importance of using Aux 8 for tech issues rather than remaining in Aux 6. Now that you're aware of this requirement, you can reference the provided website whenever you need clarification on which aux mode to use.

Additionally, we talked about your coaching sessions, which seem to be going well. However, you mentioned struggling with guideline utilization on phone calls. We took this opportunity to discuss Progressive’s approach to handling customer inquiries. Instead of relying on memory from past experiences, the expectation is to reference guidelines for every customer question or policy change. This practice ensures 100% quality scores and aligns with company expectations.

Moving forward, please reach out if you have any challenges implementing your coach’s feedback or need further support in applying these practices. Overall, it’s great to hear that you feel confident in your role and have a strong relationship with your coach—this will help you stay consistent with guideline utilization.

Let me know if you have any questions!
