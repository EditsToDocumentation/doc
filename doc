Hi Henry,

Thank you again for taking the time to meet with me today. I wanted to take a moment to recap the key points we discussed to ensure we are aligned moving forward.

AUX Mode Utilization Expectations:

AUX 1 Usage:

Please refrain from using AUX 1 at the end of your shift, including when you have PTO scheduled for the last hour of the day.
As part of our AUX mode compliance, AUX 1 should never be used during the first hour or the last hour of your shift.
Entering AUX Modes for Training/Leadership Meetings:

Moving forward, please notify me before entering any AUX modes that indicate you are in training or with a member of leadership.
This step is crucial to maintain transparency and avoid any misunderstandings, as unapproved usage could be seen as work avoidance and may lead to performance management up to and including termination.
Post-Training AUX Usage:

If you need to remain in AUX 6 after a training session has ended (for notes, follow-up tasks, etc.), please communicate that with me directly. This ensures clarity and prevents any misinterpretations.
I appreciate your attention to these guidelines. Following these procedures will help ensure smooth operations and avoid any potential compliance issues. If you have any questions or need clarification on any of the points discussed, feel free to reach out.

Thanks again for your time and cooperation!
